This report documents the analysis of a credit card fraud dataset and the algorithmâ€™s prediction of fraud 
by using neural nets and machine learning. This document is a research paper for a final project for the 
class STP 494/598: Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis taught by Dr. Robert McCulloch. The students 
in this group had no previous experience in R, Machine Learning, or Neural Nets and used the project as a
test of how far they have progressed throughout the semester
